            <p class="leading-normal my-3"> This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are
                concerned with how their 'Personally
                Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in
                US privacy law and
                information
                security, is information that can be used on its own or with other
                information to identify, contact, or
                locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read
                our privacy policy

            <h3 class="text-gray-600 my-4"> California Online Privacy Protection Act</h3>

            <p class="leading-normal my-3"> CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites
                and online services to post
                a
                privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require
                any person or company in the
                United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
                Personally Identifiable
                Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy
                on its website stating
                exactly
                the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom
                it is being shared. - See

            <p class="leading-normal my-3">According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
                <li> Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on
                    the first significant page after entering our website.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="leading-normal my-3"> Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found
                on the page specified above.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-normal my-3">You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes in our Privacy Policy

            <h3 class="text-gray-600 my-4"> CAN SPAM Act</h3>

            <p class="leading-normal my-3"> The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
                establishes requirements for
                commercial
                messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent
                to them, and spells out
                tough
                penalties for violations.</p>

            <p class="leading-normal my-3"> We collect your email address in order to:</p>

            Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions
            Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has
            occurred.

            <p class="leading-normal my-3">To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>

            If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can:

            <ul>
                <li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses</li>
                <li> Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</li>
                <li> Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</li>
                <li> Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used</li>
                <li> Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</li>
                <li> Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</li>
                <li> Follow the instructions at the bottom of each email and we will promptly remove you from ALL
                    correspondence.
                </li>
                <li> COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="leading-normal my-3">When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under
                the age of 13 years old, the
                Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The
                Federal Trade Commission,
                United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which
                spells out what operators of
                websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety
                online. We do not
                specifically
                market to children under the age of 13 years old.</p>

            <h3 class="text-gray-600 my-4"> Fair Information Practices</h3>

            <p class="leading-normal my-3"> The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law
                in the United States and the
                concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of
                data protection laws around
                the
                globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they
                should be implemented is
                critical
                to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal
                information.</p>


            <p class="leading-normal my-3"> In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
                following responsive action,
                should
                a data breach occur: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We will notify you via email Within 7 business days
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="leading-normal my-3">
                We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to
                legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.
                This
                principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
                individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute
                non-compliance by data processors.</p>
