We&#039;ve just launched our new product, [ZoneLocker](https://zonelocker.net) and we&#039;re offering a **50% discount** on new subscriptions for an entire year!

ZoneLocker is a complete monitoring solution for all of your websites.  We monitor SSL Certificates, Broken Links, Website Uptime and even monitor your DNS records to ensure your site is functioning as it should.  Whether you have 1 website or a dozen, ZoneLocker will handle your monitoring for everything and alert you when anything changes.

### Here&#039;s How It Works
ZoneLocker syncs with your major DNS providers such as AWS Route 53, Digital Ocean, Linode and Cloudflare.  We poll your DNS providers and add start monitoring all of your Zones (sites).  We scan your sites for multiple issues and alert you if we find anything.  Here&#039;s what we scan

### Uptime
We ping your site every 5 minutes.  If your site doesn&#039;t respond we&#039;ll ping it again every 2 minutes.  If it doesn&#039;t respond after 3 tries, we&#039;ll send you an email letting you know your site is down.  When we notice it back up again, we&#039;ll let you know.

### Broken Links
We&#039;ll scan all links on your site.  If any link results in a 404 or 500, we&#039;ll let you know so you can fix it.

### SSL Certificates
We&#039;ll scan your SSL certificates and alert you when they are about to expire, have already expired or are renewed.

### DNS Records
We will scan and log all of your Zone&#039;s DNS records and keep a copy for you.  If we notice any changes in the records we&#039;ll alert you.  You can download a zonefile at any time if you need a backup.
